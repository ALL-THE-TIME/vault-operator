# Setup Vault-UI on Tectonic

[Vault-UI](https://github.com/djenriquez/vault-ui) is an open source project for managing and interacting with Vault via a web UI. Vault by itself does not provide a web UI all interactions are done either using the Vault CLI or REST API calls.

### Prerequisites

- Setup an initialized and unsealed vault cluster. Use the [create-cluster][create-cluster] script for a quick setup.
- Installed and initialized Helm per [these instructions][helm-install]

This example assumes a vault cluster named `example-vault` in the namespace `vault-services`.

## Install the Vault-UI

The Vault UI can be setup by configuring and installing the Helm chart provided in the Vault UI repo.

Clone Vault-UI repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/djenriquez/vault-ui
```

Modify the file `vault-ui/kubernetes/chart/vault-ui/templates/deployment.yaml` to add the `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` environment variable to to allow self-signed HTTPS certificates.
```sh
        env:
            - name: VAULT_URL_DEFAULT
              value: {{ .Values.vault.url }}
            - name: VAULT_AUTH_DEFAULT
              value: {{ .Values.vault.auth }}
            - name: NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED
              value: '0'

```

Next modify the file `vault-ui/kubernetes/chart/vault-ui/values.yaml` to configure the way to access the Vault-UI e.g using Ingress, ClusterIP, LoadBalancer etc.

**Configuration for Ingress:**

The following example will setup the vault UI to be accessbile at the ingress host `vault-ui.ingress.staging.core-os.net` in the namespace `vault-services`.
Change the ingress hostname and namespace as needed.


If you use ingress youâ€™ll need to manually create TLS certificate that will be used to setup the ingress resource for the Vault-UI as described in the [ingress setup][ingress-tls] guide:
```sh
KUBE_NS=vault-services \
SERVER_SECRET=vault-ui-server-ingress-tls \
CLIENT_SECRET=vault-ui-client-ingress-tls \
SAN_HOSTS="vault-ui.ingress.staging.core-os.net" \
SERVER_CERT=tls.crt \
SERVER_KEY=tls.key \
hack/tls-gen.sh
```

With the above secrets the `vaules.yaml` file should be modified to look like:

```yaml
replicaCount: 1
image:
  repository: djenriquez/vault-ui
  tag: latest
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
service:
  name: vault-ui
  type: ClusterIP
  externalPort: 8000
  internalPort: 8000
ingress:
  enabled: true
  hosts:
    - vault-ui.ingress.staging.core-os.net
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: tectonic
    ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: "true"
  tls:
    - secretName: vault-ui-server-ingress-tls
      hosts:
        - vault-ui.ingress.staging.core-os.net
resources: {}
vault:
  auth: TOKEN
  url: https://example-vault:8200
```

Use Helm to install the Vault-UI within the `vault-services` namespace:

```sh
$ cd vault-ui/kubernetes/chart/vault-ui
$ helm install . --namespace=vault-services
```

## Accessing the Vault-UI

After running Helm install it will give you notes on how to access Vault-UI via port-forwarding. If you are unable to access Vault-UI via Ingress you might want to try accessing it via port-forwarding to isolate the issue.

With the ingress configuration the vault UI should be accessible at the ingress host `vault-ui.ingress.staging.core-os.net`. Make sure to setup the DNS record for the ingress host to make it accessible as described in the [ingress guide][ingress-dns].
